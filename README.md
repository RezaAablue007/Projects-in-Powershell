# Projects-in-Powershell

This repo has been created to store some of the small projects I've worked on in Windows Powershell.

Projects include:
- TDR (Windows Timeout Detection and Recovery) Level and WinDBG (Windows Kernel Debug) configuration
- Addition of Registry Keys to any PC system
- Installation of AMD Chipset and Graphics Drivers with the default setup.exe package
- Installation of Realtek non-HAP Audio Driver, Network Driver, and SD Card Reader Driver onto any PC system
- Sideloading GFX Driver FW content for minor changes in GFX Driver capability
- Updating the vBIOS (BIOS of a Discrete Graphics Card)
- Generating and "pushing" a Windows SleepStudyReport to a network shared folder for storage and future reference
- Analysis of SleepStudyReport, based on HW/SW DRIPS (Deepest run-time idle platform state) scores and top offenders (HW/SW components that are active in Modern Standby power-saving cycles)
